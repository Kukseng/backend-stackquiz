## üîß Configuration

### OpenAI Settings (application.yml)

```yaml
openai:
  api:
    key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY:your-api-key-here}
    model: gpt-4.1-mini
    temperature: 0.7
    max-tokens: 2000
```

### Customization Options

You can customize:
- **Model**: Change to different OpenAI models
- **Temperature**: Adjust creativity (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)
- **Max Tokens**: Control response length

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Topics
‚úÖ **Good**: "Quadratic equations and the quadratic formula"  
‚ùå **Poor**: "Math"

### 2. Use Additional Context
```json
{
  "topic": "JavaScript",
  "additionalContext": "Focus on ES6 features like arrow functions, promises, and async/await. Avoid basic syntax."
}
```

### 3. Review Before Publishing
Always review AI-generated questions before using them in live quizzes.

### 4. Optimal Batch Size
Generate 5-10 questions at a time for best quality and speed.

### 5. Include Explanations
Set `includeExplanations: true` to help students learn from their mistakes.

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive data
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limits to prevent abuse
4. **Authentication**: Secure AI endpoints with proper authentication
5. **Cost Control**: Monitor OpenAI API usage to control costs

---

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

Approximate costs using OpenAI's pricing (as of 2024):

| Operation | Tokens | Cost (approx) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 question (MCQ) | ~200 | $0.0004 |
| 5 questions | ~1000 | $0.002 |
| 10 questions | ~2000 | $0.004 |
| 100 questions | ~20000 | $0.04 |

*Note: Actual costs may vary based on OpenAI pricing and model used.*

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not configured"
**Solution**: Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

### Issue: "Failed to generate questions"
**Solutions**:
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify API key is valid
- Check OpenAI service status
- Review server logs for detailed errors

### Issue: "Quiz not found"
**Solution**: Verify the quiz ID exists in the database

### Issue: Questions are low quality
**Solutions**:
- Be more specific with the topic
- Add detailed context in `additionalContext`
- Adjust difficulty level
- Try generating fewer questions at once

---

## üìà Performance

### Response Times (Approximate)

| Questions | Response Time |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1 question | 2-4 seconds |
| 5 questions | 5-10 seconds |
| 10 questions | 10-20 seconds |
| 20 questions | 20-40 seconds |

*Times vary based on OpenAI API performance and network conditions.*
